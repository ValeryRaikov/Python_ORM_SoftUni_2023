This project is created by using an already defined skeleton provided by the SoftUni team. My first ever web based project using the Django framework after the 'Python ORM course'. It is a simple web page application that shows base functionality of working with Django urls, forms, views as well as the already studied models, migrations and apps. I will futhermore extend my knowledge and experience with Django in the next course -> 'Python Web' where Django is used for creating wep apps, but first I will cover the 'JavaScript FrontEnd' course! Enjoy :)
